# FIR-Filter-Design
The repository contains the matlab code and the associated documents in designing a FIR Bandpass Filter using Kaiser windowing technique.

# Abstract
The performance of a digital control system is heavily dependant on the interference mixed with the desired input signal. Therefore, processing of the input signal before feeding into the system is mandatory to ensure a reliable output. Finite duration Impulse Response (FIR) filters play an important role in the processing of a digital signal. In this project, a Bandpass FIR filter is designed using the Kaiser window function to behave according to a pre specified set of requirements. The filter is designed and studied using Matlab software package (without using the inbuilt filter design functions) and its performance is analyzed using a test signal.
